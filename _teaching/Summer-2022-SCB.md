Summer Coding Bootcamp, the most extensive online event held by the Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering, took place in the summer of 2022.
This coding Bootcamp is something I'm proud to be a part of, both as an instructor and as a part of the crew that made it happen.
Python and its prevalent packages, Git, and GitHub are the topics covered in this Bootcamp.
