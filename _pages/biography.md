## Before getting into the University:

As a kid, I was curious, always asking questions to the point that everyone would get a headache! In elementary school, I was a top-performing student, so I got accepted to the [Governmental leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmental_leading_high_school) middle school, a school where only top students who pass the entrance exam will get into it. In high school, I was a computer enthusiast but with average grades.

## During my first two years of University as an undergraduate student:

After taking the annual university entrance exam, I got accepted to the Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan. I began my studies as a Computer Engineering major.
I was Remarkably superb at my programming-related courses during my first two years. I was immensely devoted to programming but didn't precisely understand what I wanted to do in the future, and I didn't know how vital mathematics was. Due to that, I hardly got any good grades in my math & Science classes in my first two years of being a student.

It's worth mentioning that because I performed so well in my computer-related courses, our department offered me an opportunity to pick Software Engineering as the area of my major. Our department's software engineering is the most robust and highly competitive sub-field. Not many students get the chance to get into this area of Computer Engineering major in our school.

## After my 4th semester ended:

After my 4th semester at the school, I made several new connections with other students around Iran. I began to research and explore what I wanted to be in the future, and ultimately, it came to my sense that I would like to continue my computer science studies. Indeed at first, all of this wasn't clear to me, I just had some wild guesses, but I trusted in my decisions.

Even after realizing I desired to continue my studies, I wasn't confident about which sub-field of computer science I liked. But I recalled from my 3rd semester that I undoubtedly enjoyed my Data Structure and Algorithms course, so I reached out to Dr. Fahimeh Dabaghi-Zarandi to become a teaching assistant for this course.

Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi offered one of my friends and me a position to become teaching assistants for both "Data Structure and Algorithms" and "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" courses. We had a blast that semester being teaching assistants to lots of students. We flawlessly poured our heart and soul into that job, and as a result, everyone was delighted, including our students, ourselves, and Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi.

## A new chapter in my life just began:

Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi reached out to me to offer us the position of Teaching Assistant once again, and we were more than happy to accept.
At that moment, it struck me that I am incredibly eager about theoretical computer science, and I would adore continuing my academic journey in the field of Algorithms. So again, I contacted Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi, asking her if she had any open position as Undergraduate Research Assistant for me. Thankfully she gave me a chance, and ultimately, I was selected to be her undergrad research assistant. We began our research on algorithms related to Community Detection instantly.

In the third year of my studies, I conceded how vital my courses and my academic journey were to me; thus, every single semester after my 4th semester, I studied as hard as I could to absorb as much knowledge as I could and get the most satisfactory grades that I ever had.
And because of doing so, when I was in my 8th semester, I ranked 6th among all computer engineering students of Vali-e-Asr university that started their studies in 2018.

In my 8th semester, I was honored to be a Teaching Assistant of Dr. Mojtaba Sabbagh-Jafari for the Intro to Information Retrieval course.

And in the summer after that, I had the concession to collaborate in teaching with Dr. Amir Hossein Hadjahmadi. In my 9th semester, I am thrilled to be Dr. Hadjahmadi's Teaching Assistant, Dr. Sabbagh-Jafari's, and Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi's.

Also, I am happy to declare That my first paper has been published in the Journal of Network and Computer Applications, a Q1 journal with a 7.574 Impact Factor and 15.7 CiteScore. [[doi]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103492)

My friends and I are working on two new papers under the supervision of Dr. Fahimeh Dabaghi-Zarandi.

In the summer of 2022, Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering held our department's most extensive online event, The Summer Coding Bootcamp. And I'm proud to be part of it, I have helped the crew to make it happen, and I'm one of the instructors of this coding Bootcamp. in this Bootcamp, I teach Python and its prevalent packages, Git, and GitHub.

From the onset of my 9th semester, I'm delighted to announce that I will be the Head of the Teaching Assistant Committee at Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering. My job is to bridge remarkable students and professors, nominate and present eligible Teaching Assistants for each course to professors, accumulate a prominent team of TAs per course, give my experiences to new TAs and prepare them to be accomplished teaching assistants.
