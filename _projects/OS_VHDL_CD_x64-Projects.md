## Round Robin time scheduling algorithm
* [Github repo](https://github.com/benymaxparsa/Round-robin-scheduling)
Overview
Round robin scheduling is a pre-emptive algorithm commonly used in operating systems to schedule processes.
In round robin scheduling, the CPU is assigned to each process in a queue turn by turn for a time period. Once the time is over, the process is moved to the end of the queue and the CPU is shifted to the next process in the queue. In this manner, processes are handled from a cyclic queue until the burst time of a process has passed.
