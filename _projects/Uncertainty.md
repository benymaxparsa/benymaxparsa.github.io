- Uncertainty is an action-adventure space-shooter game, and currently, It’s under development.
- We have utilized the beta version of this game as our ”Software Engineering Lab” course project.
- Our game is an open-source game hosted on GitHub.
- It's made with Unity3D
- Currently, our team isn't at its peak since all its members are busy at university. Still, we're looking forward to continuing the Uncertainty and eventually finishing it when we're free.
- This project consists of:
  - Carefully used design patterns
  - Followed the SOLID principles in codes
  - Project Requirements
  - Project Needs assessment
  - Project Scenario
  - Usecase Diagram
  - Activity Diagram
  - Class Diagram
  - Sequence Diagram
  - Eye-catching art and 3D models
  - Scalable and reusable codebase

## Project Requirements:
### Functional Requirements:
- The player can move the spaceship
- The player can fight enemies likewise, vice versa..
- There is a bossfight in the level

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance - In order to ensure smooth lagging-free performance on all computers, the game must be optimized
- Scalability - Software Architecture must be designed in such a way that the game can be expanded later on
- Reliability - The game should not crash or present any issues that cause it to malfunction
